    ('Anything Can Happen', 'anything-can-happen', 'But that doesn&rsquo;t make it good.', '<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1208343/Abigail_K._Fiedler/">Abigail K. Fiedler</a>', '<p>In October 2013, the Harvard Admissions Office <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5pKtnmHTxg">released a video</a> that made a bold claim. “Anything Could Happen at Harvard,” they said. Anything. And maybe they weren’t lying. From bomb scares to upset UC elections, 2013-’14 proved as eventful as the first 10 minutes of the average “Scandal” episode—not that you’d know it from the admissions video.</p><p>If you’re unimpressed with the ’90s Microsoft Movie Maker editing that can definitely happen at Harvard, the Admissions Office has someone up its sleeve ready to dispel your cynicism and wow you with his appearance: Matt Damon, formerly of the Class of 1992 and star of “Jersey Girl” and “We Bought a Zoo.” Apart from proving that Harvard still has the cachet to attract celebs (Tyra, Tyga), Matt’s appearance is a little misleading. “He gave me a flat A in the class, which is a big deal,” he says of the playwriting class in which he began “Good Will Hunting.” Apparently no one told him about grade inflation.</p><p>If Matt Damon doesn’t impress you, Jeremy Lin ’10 in his Harvard Basketball finest, also makes an appearance. Lin also wants you to know that anything could happen because of Harvard. You could become “an economist, a politician, or even a professional basketball player.” Maybe you could, Jeremy, but the rest of the student body is going into consulting.</p><p>But Harvard is definitely more than its famous alums, and they want you to know that the experience you’ll have here is truly unique. Anthony the freshman wakes up every day and can’t believe he’s at Harvard. He eats in Annenberg. He visits other Harvard schools and thinks the Medical School is “pretty cool.” He gets to work with his professor on research projects. Anthony’s experience is truly unique because the rest of us only interact with our professors at faculty dinner or that one awkward time we go to office hours and run out of things to say after five minutes. Plus, we rarely venture outside the college campus. Anthony, you’re killing it.</p><p>And Anthony isn’t the only one. The Admissions Office may have selected culturally and socially stratified students for the video (there are 12 students and a Tommy Lee Jones ’69 voiceover to tell you how diverse Harvard’s student body is—all 50 states and over 100 countries if you were wondering), but they’re all of the same enthusiastic ilk.</p>                                                                                                                    <p>Then again, maybe the exclusion of student activism, Houses without hot breakfast, and realistic portraits of the student experience at Harvard wasn’t intentional. Anything, even mistakes, can happen at Harvard, right?</p>'),

Goldstein</a> and <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1210987/Eloise_A._Lynton/">Eloise A. Lynton</a>', '<p>The numbers are out, and Harvard has announced that tuition will go up next year by 3.9 percent, costing students a grand total of $58,607. This marks the largest percentage increase in tuition in the last seven years. FM spoke to high-level administrators and members of the UC to determine where the money is going, so you have specific endeavors to direct your anger towards as you take out loans.</p><p><b>01 VERITAFFLES AND VERITOMELETTES</b></p><p>It’s Sunday morning. Well, Sunday mid-afternoon, more realistically. You roll up to brunch, sunglasses on, Advil in hand, ready to pounce on a crisp, warm waffle, branded with truth and prestige. Would all food taste that much better if labeled with the Harvard insignia? Next year we’ll find out. Rumor has it that Harvard is using our extra tuition money to expand its Veritas brand beyond the Veritaffle. Need a snack? Grab a Veritapple to go. What about some sweet Veritoatmeal for breakfast?. How does a cheesy Veritomelette sound? Veriswai? You tell us.</p><p><b>02 HEIGHTENED SECURITY CHECKS</b></p><p>You spent the year complaining about those thirty seconds it takes to have your stuff checked every time you leave a library. But who’s to say you aren’t hiding highly valuable Widener material beneath an unfinished Ec problem set? Next year, part of the tuition increase will fund increased security, completed in part by the TSA. Say goodbye to quick and easy check-ins at the desk and say hello to body scanners, metal detectors, and full body pat downs. You won’t be leaving Widener with anything (including your dignity) in under 10 minutes next year.</p>                                                                                                                    <p><b>03 UPPING THE ACCESS: ID SWIPES</b></p><p>You thought your Harvard ID could be used for just about anything—purchasing snacks from the vending machines, (occasionally) doing your laundry, receiving access to dorms, enjoying John from Annenberg’s behind-the-back swiping shenanigans. This fall, one can only imagine what those useful little pieces of plastic will be able to do for you. Next year’s Montclair purchased with Crimson Cash? A suite at the Charles for the night on your board plus? You name it, your swipe’s got it.</p><p><b>04 THE EIGHT-MINUTE RULE</b></p><p>Harvard Time has saved you in countless situations. Want to stop for coffee before your 9 a.m.? Need to grab a book in your dorm before class? Gotta spend those seven minutes in heaven with a special someone? Harvard’s seven minute rule lets you do all that and more. With the extra money, we’re thinking the College will up the ante to eight minutes, thus paying off TFs in order for  you to miss yet another minute of instructional opportunity. Think of all you’ll be able to do with that extra time: put sugar in your coffee, take notes on a reading that eluded your gaze for weeks, enjoy that eighth minute in heaven.</p><p><b>05 PARTY AT HOLYOKE</b></p><p>This one’s top secret. A reliable source that rhymes with “New Joust” has confirmed that the Smith Campus Center is being renovated. Its model? The one area in which Yale beats us: Toad’s. Harvard’s biannually attended nightclub has decided to work with the powers that be at Harvard to aid in the colonization of Greek fraternity Tao Omega Alpha Delta Sigma. On Friday and Saturday nights, students can line up in front of Delta Sig and potentially enter on weekend evenings based on their attractiveness and/or lack of clothing. The tuition increase seeks to fill the gaping hole left by Harvard’s acute shortage of male-controlled social spaces. Consulting the CEO of Toad’s ain’t cheap, but having fewer freshmen constantly complaining about their lack of social lives will definitely be the worth the price.</p><p><b>06 MOVING THE RIVER</b></p><p>Your trek over the river to reach the stadium is no more. Harvard’s latest project is the relocation of the Charles. Why should our student athletes have to spend an extra half hour commuting to and from each practice? Harvard has decided to relocate the river few miles away, bringing the athletic facilities much closer to campus. Think they’re favoring athletes? Administrators insist that’s not the case. The roommate of any athlete will thank Harvard profusely for saving them that extra 15 minutes of sleep. This endeavor will benefit athlete, scholar, and athlete-scholar alike.</p>'),
    ('Best of: House Listservs', 'house-lists', 'Turns out that you don&rsquo;t need to search someone&rsquo;s email, all you need is a house list.', '<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1209898/Olivia_M.%20_Munk/">Olivia M. Munk</a>', '<p><i>By the time you’ve been sorted into a House, you’ve (hopefully) removed yourself from the infinite email lists you joined in a sugar-induced haze at the Activities Fair in the fall. However, “[INSERT HOUSE HERE] Open” soon becomes the listserv you love to hate. With the opportunity to reach hundreds of classmates with a single click, students tend to crowdsource even the most intimate of their insatiable questions and quandaries. Because you only have access to a twelfth of the messaging mischief, FM has compiled the Best of House Listservs 2013-’14.</i></p><p>WINTHROP</p><p>Winthrop is not the smallest House, nor is it the largest. A certain resident, however,  found the dining hall to be four flights too far from her bedroom and implored that neighbors “help out a girl with tired legs :)” and tell her if there was anything good at Brain Break.</p><p>While Girl with Tired Legs waited atop her ivory tower for a kind soul to bring her a PB&amp;J, others expressed their support for the budding musicians of Harvard—in the daytime, at least. More than one poor soul with a midterm in the morning let the House know their slumbers and/or all nighters were being interrupted by trumpeters and piano players during the wee hours of the morning. If they must do so, one emailer implored, could they at least bust out a lullaby?</p><p>In the entryway on the opposite side of Tired Girl sans Brain Break, an unfortunate student was foiled by their own hygienic pursuits. We’ve all lost a sock or two in the bowels of the dryer, but to lose an entire load? Let’s all hope you were just trying to remove a stain from the Emperor’s New Clothes.</p>                                                                                                                    <p>MATHER</p><p>Missed connections are no longer just for sexy strangers on the Subway. One Matherite found herself in a Craigslist-worthy encounter when she took custody of the umbrella left in the library by a tall, foreign, possibly crew-rowing, and “unremarkably” brunet male. As far as we know, Unremarkable Crew Brunet is still wandering around getting wet in the rain, while the girl faithfully keeps his umbrella company. There’s a romantic comedy somewhere in there.</p><p>On April Fools’ Day, the sender of one email was (we hope) the only one foolin’ around. A common room frequenter was turned accidental voyeur when a couple decided the singles in Mather was just too stuffy to enjoy each other’s company. For the sake of everyone involved, we hope the ping-pong tables are regularly sanitized.</p><p>On the surface, Matherites seem to enjoy office technology of yore more than anything else on a Friday or Saturday night, preferable with a PBR or two in hand. No, they don’t have pressing memos or contracts to send, nor are they beginning of movement of 1985-focused Ludditism. “Faxing” has somehow become a euphemism for partying on the Mather-open listserv. In a recent post, one student asked if there was a fax machine for student use within the concrete complex and quickly received several replies promising a “HUGE fax machine” for students, all night, in a particular Tower room. We just really, really hope the hosts played “Damn It Feels Good To Be a Gangsta” in homage to “Office Space.”</p><p>KIRKLAND</p><p>To the “grinch” that stole someone’s Christmas tree before Winter Break, you better have deconstructed the goods and distributed miniature trees to children in hospitals to recreate the cheer stolen from the person left in the lurch. Could you just let them know when the tree will be making its way back home? The self-described “mother” misses it (cue the sad “Charlie Brown Christmas Time is Here” music).</p><p>CABOT</p><p>Distracted by the pure delight of a non-HUDS meal, one Cabotian accidentally abandoned his Panera takeout in the dining hall. When he returned to reunite with his dinner and it was nowhere to be found, he took to the House list to locate the missing sandwich. A helpful resident shortly replied that he had seen two pieces of bread with some stuff in the middle left behind after dinner hours.  We have yet to come up with a better description to help locate the missing masterpiece.</p><p>ELIOT</p><p>If your spring party is called “Party” but in a foreign language with an accent circumflex, it must be a better party, right? Initiated by an enterprising senior, a market for F&ecirc;te plus ones has already emerged on the House list. Students sell their extra tickets now for a reasonable price, only to sell them for much more closer to the event. After one student called out the senior for attempting to swindle fellow residents, a debate was sparked to discuss the ethical implications of making money off friends and blockmates. Everyone seemed to have a say for various reasons, including a folklore and mythology concentrator who thoughtfully supplied the tale of Ethan Allen for a more allegorical approach to the situation. In the end, everyone would be much happier if they got off the Internet and found dates to invite as their plus ones.</p>'),

The restaurant was known for its zebra-patterned dining room and exotic fare, all of which will slowly turn to dust under the ceaseless rush of time. After the restaurant’s closing, The Krokodiloes, who regularly played Sunday brunch, were reminded of the inherent transience of all human endeavors. They wailed for hours on end, sending up a dirge that brought tears to the eyes of passersby. The restaurant, by all means still sprightly and youthful, died quietly in its sleep. Locals mourned the loss of such an effervescent establishment, the shining lodestar in the Harvard Square firmament. Our lives are a little darker, a little less colorful, without Upstairs on the Square.</p><p><b>TOMMY DOYLE’S</b></p><p>Tommy Doyle’s sadly makes this list of tragic losses. The pub shut down after nine years of operation, raisingurgent questions of just where exactly frats would hold their annual fundraisers. The MAC quad? Petsi Pies? Under a giant circus tent? It’s just not the same. Rising rents in the Square and high maintenance costs prompted the decision to close one of the Square’smost beloved institutions. After the closing, disillusioned seniors and drunk lacrosse players were seen to wander aimlessly about the Square for days, dead-eyed and disoriented.Their tragic plight underscores how missed Tommy Doyle’s will be. The world of Irish-themed pubs feels hollow; the beer on tap turns to ash in our mouths. The sun is gone, the sky overcast. We mourn.</p><p><b>ORGANISMIC AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY</b></p><p>“O, shattered youth! Importunity of Fate! Who can say what crystal deeds lay before ye?” Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrators were heard to proclaim shortly after the decision to rename the concentration Integrative Biology was announced. At an age when most concentrations are just awakening to consciousness, the OEB concentration passed out of this mortal realm to seek its fortunes in that other kingdom, Death. It was only six years old. Concentrators recall that OEB was a super chill concentration, maybe a little confused about its identity,but who wasn’t back then?</p><p>With OEB’s passing we’ve lost a truly smart-sounding concentration name and a golden opportunity for orgasm jokes. Will the College be able to weather this shocking and untimely loss? Only time will tell.

    ('Inflation', 'inflation', 'We give this article an A+ and 50 trillion Zimbabwe dollars.', '<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1208247/Amy_L._Weiss-Meyer/">Amy L. Weiss-Meyer</a>', '<p>Five years ago this spring, in March of 2009, an Adams House senior enlisted 30 of his friends to help him inflate 6,000 blue balloons, transforming the Adams Art Space into a sea of latex and static. The idea, he told The Crimson, was to give his peers an opportunity to enjoy themselves.</p><p>“One thing I’ve noticed about Harvard is that people tend to take themselves and their lives too seriously,” said Will M. Skinner ’09, who was behind the project. “We need simple fun things sometimes.”</p><p>And so it was, whether or not Skinner intended it to be this way, that inflation itself was made manifest—a physical representation of a concept that seems to haunt Harvard’s campus year in and year out. If the inflation of so many blue balloons was a happy antidote to our excessive self-seriousness, the claims leveled against Harvard students that invoke the word inflation are, more often than not, negative ones.</p><p>Whoever is to blame for the perpetuation of such stereotypes—the media seems a likely culprit, but then again, so do we—Harvard students are continually accused of partaking in an education that inflates, perhaps artificially, our credentials, our grades, and above all, our egos. The word is a loaded one; it is tied up in questions of class, race, and privilege. Inflation, when it comes to Harvard students, tends to make people wince.</p><p>In December of this school year, Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 stood up in a Faculty meeting to ask Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris if he could confirm that the most frequently given grade at Harvard College was an A-. Harris told the assembled faculty that “a straight A” was, in fact, the most frequently awarded grade, while an A- was the median grade. Mansfield was angry, but he was not surprised. Instead, he wrote in an email to The Crimson, he was “further depressed.” Inflation, simply put, deflated Mansfield.</p>                                                                                                                    <p>What sometimes got lost in the subsequent debate over Harvard’s academic standards was that this conversation was hardly new. Peer universities like Yale and Princeton were (and are) actively engaged in their own investigations on the matter, and, for his part, Mansfield had been outspoken about grade inflation since the 1970s. In 1993, Mansfield told Harvard Magazine that grade inflation coincided with the advent of affirmative action admissions processes. “Many white professors were unwilling to give C&rsquo;s to Black students,” he said, “so they wouldn&rsquo;t give C&rsquo;s to white students.”</p><p>But inflation does not always refer to grades; it is a versatile term and often has a more economic meaning. In 1981, the Cambridge City Council was concerned that Harvard’s long-term low-interest mortgage loan program was forcing neighbors of Harvard professors to pay “artificially inflated property taxes.” The Council asked that the University provide detailed information about the program in an effort to protect Cambridge residents who weren’t affiliated with Harvard from such inflation.</p><p>And in 1993, Harvard president Neil L. Rudenstine refuted the claim that universities’ use of students’ tuition dollars to fund research was causing the inflation of tuition costs. Another important factor in rising costs, Rudenstine reminded reporters, was the economic inflation of the late ’70s and early ’80s. Once again, Harvard had to defend itself against the perception of its inflated status.</p><p>Next, Rudenstine’s students looked around at the job market and applied their own inflation, exaggerating or in some cases flat out lying about their qualifications. "I think in general, people inflate their resumés," Derek C. Araujo &rsquo;99 admitted to The Crimson in 1996. Still, some students countered that they chose not to inflate their resumés for reasons of moral responsibility.</p><p>Not to be overlooked, of course, is the all too common practice of ego inflation that, for many, accompanies an acceptance letter to Harvard College. Every November, thousands of eager fans don blue and crimson apparel and make their way to the Yale Bowl or the Harvard Stadium to participate in the biggest annual showing of their (perhaps inflated, almost certainly elitist) school pride. In 1982, a group of MIT students decided to prank this hallowed gathering by building “a larger-than-life balloon emblazoned with the school’s initials” that would self-inflate and rise from below the field partway through The Game.</p><p>“The ground began to shake,” reported The Crimson in a retrospective 2002 piece. “A nozzle burrowed its way out of the turf near midfield and began to inflate a large black balloon. The crowd stood in quiet awe while both teams retreated wearily from the minivan-sized globe.” Images of this incomprehensible inflation were broadcast across the country that day, providing onlookers nationwide with a very visual substitution for the negative connotations surrounding “inflation at Harvard.”</p><p>So remember, as administrators and commentators throw around accusations of inflation like it’s going out of style, that the word has many meanings at Harvard. Sometimes, it’s just a well-placed balloon, or 6,000 blue ones; low cost, not for a grade, and certainly not on Will Skinner’s resum&eacute;.</p>'),

Tran &#39;16    </div>    </div></div></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>One day several weeks ago, as he was waiting to hear back from fellowship applications, Jesse G. Sanchez ’14 received a phone call from his hometown in City Heights, San Diego. It was his mother. “Jesse, something came in the mail for you,” she said in Spanish. “But I don’t know what it is—what’s Fulbright?”</span></p><p><span>Sanchez credits his mother, who was only able to attain a third-grade education before emigrating to the United States, with much of his success in life. But as a first-generation student at Harvard, he has struggled at times to reconcile home and school environments whose very vocabularies differ.</span></p>                                                                                                                    <p><span>“It creates a sense of isolation wherever they are,” he says of first-generation students, particularly those who are among the only students from their community to have gone to college. When Sanchez returns home for vacation, it can be difficult to connect with or even find time to see old friends, many of whom have been working full-time since high school or have children and families to support. He finds it easier to relate to fellow alumni of Reality Changers, a non-profit that has provided academic support, financial assistance and leadership training to him and other potential first-generation college students.</span></p><p><span>Just getting to Harvard, of course, presents an even greater challenge to these students, who must navigate applications, fee waivers, and recommendation letters without help or experience from their parents, at high schools with usually overworked and often skeptical counselors. Over the past decade in particular, Harvard has made a concerted effort to ease this process, reaching out to prospective low-income and minority students (for whom there tends to be overlap with first-generation status) through initiatives like the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program.</span></p><p><span>But for many, the true challenges begin only with entrance through Widener Gate on the first day of freshman year. The past year has seen efforts by students and alumni alike to bridge a possible disconnect between administrative enthusiasm to attract first-generation students, and weaker support and outreach once they arrive on campus. For the students, part of this process has included the development of a “first-gen” identity as something to be embraced.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Freshman year can be overwhelming for many Harvard students. “When you first arrive, everyone’s lost,” says Nelida Garcia ’14, a cheerful, effervescent Chicago native and daughter of Mexican immigrants. “That experience of feeling a little bit out of it—it’s pretty universal.” But the transition to college is intensified for students who are the first in their family to enter college at all, much less one of the country’s most selective. For these students, figuring out how to approach a professor in class, or what to say to a professor in office hours, or even how to interact with peers whose experiences and families are vastly different from their own, is far from straightforward.</span></p><p><span>Garcia recalls talking with a classmate her freshman fall about their mutual struggles with Expos 20. The classmate confided that he had given one of his papers to his mother to look over. She was taken aback: “That’s something I never could think of doing.” The inability to rely on their parents for paper critiques or career support, for example, can be a major facet of the first-generation student experience. But the differences can also be more subtle. Non-first-gen students, according to Garcia, arrive at college equipped with a “toolkit” for interacting with others more confidently.</span></p><p><span>“They have this better ability to maneuver different areas,” she says, from office hours to faculty dinners, “because it’s more familiar to them.” Yet for many first-generation students, these social cues have to be learned on the ground. While their peers can often serve as a means of support for this process, other Harvard students—particularly in the early college years—can also cause further isolation. Daniel M. Lobo ’14 says that he was astounded, upon arriving at Harvard, by the sheer concentration of wealth on campus. He’d never been exposed to anything like it before.</span></p><p><span>“It was hard at the beginning just to figure out what to talk to people about,” he says. “Our experiences were—are—so different, and I didn’t really know how to reconcile those differences.” Eventually, he made friends who helped him navigate through the recruiting process, as he gradually realized that the only careers (rather than jobs) he had really learned about—medicine, from his family doctor, or education, from his high school teachers—were far from his only options.</span></p><p><span>Many students recognize that other resources do exist at Harvard for students overwhelmed with the academic and social requirements of Harvard undergraduate life. Lobo, for instance, turned to his freshman advisor, a counselor at the Bureau of Study Counsel responsible for advising many first-gen students, for advice and support during his first year. PAFs, freshman proctors, and the Bureau of Study Counsel all provide counseling or workshops to ease the transition into Harvard, while HFAI publishes a 71-page booklet entitled Shoestring Strategies for Life @ Harvard directed towards students from lower-income backgrounds. But this year was the first that PAF training included a module specifically directed toward the needs of first-gen students. For some students, however, the availability of resources has not been matched by outreach alerting them to the existence of such resources.</span></p><p><span>“Harvard has a lot of institutional resources in place to support students as they transition to college,” says Sanchez. “But from my experience, there were very few people that could connect with my personal experience in terms of growing up below the US poverty line, growing up in areas where murder and drugs were pretty common.”</span></p><p><span>“[Existing resources] did provide a lot of support that I definitely benefited from,” he goes on, “but it was sometimes challenging to connect holistically and feel a real sense of empathy, in terms of having someone say, ‘I know what that’s like. I went through it, too.’”</span></p><p><span>Sometimes, even reaching out can be a challenge. “The problem was, I didn’t know what was appropriate to ask,” says Viet D. Tran ’16, who grew up in a largely immigrant community in Texas. “At home I took care of everything. I didn’t have my own problems—I had other people’s problems.”</span></p><p><span>He continues, “It’s this challenge of figuring out: What do I classify as a problem?”</span></p><p><span>In some ways, these challenges for first-generation students at Harvard have not changed significantly over the past several decades. When Kevin B. Jennings ’85 arrived on campus, he felt similarly isolated and alone. In addition, he bore the burden of what he considered to be a moral judgment. “When I was at Harvard there was a really deep sense of shame around being first-generation,” he says. “There was a sense that if your family was poor, it was somehow their fault.”</span></p><p><span>But what has changed, he thinks, is a growing sense of consciousness concerning first-generation identity. “The very term ‘first-generation’ didn’t even exist five years ago,” he says. Part of this growing self-consciousness has taken place thanks to Jennings’s own efforts. As a former member of the Alumni Association’s board of directors, Jennings was part of a working group which looked at the Office of Career Services. He realized that the confusion and uncertainty he had felt in searching for a career had not gone away for current first-gens. “The average first-generation student doesn’t have parents who work in investment banking or consulting, or any of those fields,” Jennings says. “The feeling of not understanding the universe of Harvard or understanding what I was supposed to do after Harvard—I was seeing those things occur again.”</span></p><p><span>His experience ultimately led to the creation, two years ago, of the First Generation Alumni Mentorship Program, which pairs incoming freshmen with first-generation alumni for mentorship and advising. Last year, according to Jennings, about 15 percent of the incoming class was first-generation; 130 students, or about 8 percent, applied to be paired with 103 alumni volunteers.</span></p><p><span>Jennings understands this program as one that fills a gap between Harvard’s outreach initiatives to prospective applicants, and provides support to students once they arrive at Harvard. HFAI and UMRP are both focused on attracting low-income, minority, and first-generation students to Harvard—not on supporting current students on campus. “I don’t think we have done everything we could to make sure people feel supported and included once they get here, and feel like they can succeed,” Jennings says.</span></p><p><span>Or, as Garcia puts it, “If you admit students that are highly qualified but who might not have a support system in place once they arrive, it puts them at a disadvantage from the start.”</span></p><p><span>A similar sentiment prompted the establishment of the Harvard College First Generation Student Union, which became an official student organization last fall. Lobo, who was inspired to start the organization after attending a panel with first-generation faculty members several years ago, sees the group as having several aspects to its mission. The first is to provide first-generation students—freshmen in particular—with certain resources, or to direct them to resources that already exist. “There’s an opportunity to reduce the amount of time it takes for first-gen students to transition,” he says. While many of Harvard’s resources can be fruitfully directed toward challenges facing first-gen students, these resources require proctors, academic advisers and PAFs to be aware of them and willing to communicate their importance. Lobo and others see the Student Union as filling in the gaps when such communication, for a variety of reasons, just doesn’t take place.</span></p><p><span>More generally, the group is also committed to building a sense of first-gen identity. While there is some overlap between first-gen students and ethnic or cultural groups on campus, the lack of any visual cues means that it’s more difficult for first-gen students to recognize and identify each other. For Jennings, who is openly gay, this process has some parallels with the process of “coming out,” of finding pride rather than shame in a kind of identity that is often not immediately evident.</span></p><p><span>“We want to build a community where people are advertising their identity with pride and connecting with others based on their identity,” says Lobo. “And feeling empowered about it.”</span></p><p><span>Finally, though, the group plans to advocate for more institutional commitment to supporting first-generation students; according to Lobo, “recognizing that a lot of our peer institutions have a lot more resources and programming.” When Lobo was accepted to Georgetown, for instance, he was also admitted into a program called Community Scholars, which brings first-gen students to campus about a month before the beginning of the semester. It includes skills-building workshops, such as panels on how to talk to professors, and strives to build a community for the students that take part. “Can we mimic this program?” asks Lobo. “It’s something we should at least be discussing.”</span></p><p><span>Others suggest room for improvement in the establishment of a first-generation student center, similar to the Women’s Center in the basement of Canaday. Currently, Garcia says, “people tend to stick to people who they feel are from similar backgrounds because there aren’t any spaces where they feel comfortable enough.” For Garcia, such a center would serve not to isolate the first-gen students from the broader community, but rather to provide both a space for empowerment and the opportunity to educate the student body about the first-gen experience. “I think it would benefit the entire community,” she says.</span></p><p><span>For Jennings, possible changes might also include developing more targeted, specific training to educate freshmen proctors on the first-gen experience, as well as ensuring that existing programs like OCS are “first-generation inclusive.”</span></p><p><span>Before starting to advocate more actively for first-generation issues, Lobo says that he thought no one on higher administrative levels was talking about the challenges facing students like him. “I realized quickly that I was wrong, that these conversations have been taking place,” he says. “There just hasn’t been much action.”</span></p><p><span>He continues, “That tells me that the administration realizes that there’s an opportunity for improvement with the first-gen experience here. But I think they’ve realized that the transition is not happening as quickly as it could.”</span></p><p><span>Programs like the First Generation Student Union and Alumni Mentorship Program will perhaps, then, provide a model for more sustained administrative changes. For Jennings, at least, the prospects are bright. “The 2013-2014 school year is going to go down,” he claims, “as the turning point for first-generation students at Harvard.”</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p>'),

He speaks quickly and efficiently&mdash;this man has places to go. He is the classic self-made man: he grew up in Brooklyn, New York, with two working parents, neither of whom had gone to college. He was a terrible elementary and high school student, he says, with about a 68 percent average. &ldquo;I made it to Brooklyn College by the skin of my teeth,&rdquo; he recounts. His family would not have been able to afford tuition, but luckily, attending Brooklyn College was free at the time. Dershowitz improved his grades, earning straight A&rsquo;s in college and then at Yale Law School. In 1964, at the age of 25, he began teaching at Harvard, soon becoming one of the youngest tenured professors at the Universisty. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been doing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had one job in my life&mdash;a professor at Harvard&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve had it for 50 years.&rdquo;</p><p>Clearly, teaching at Harvard is not all he has been doing. According to the biographical statement on his website, he has litigated 38 homicide cases and authored 30 fiction and non-fiction works. He has won over 100 court cases and lectured to over a million people across the globe.</p><p>I ask Dershowitz what he remembers about his first year teaching at Harvard Law School. &ldquo;I remember every single student that I called on in my class,&rdquo; he responds confidently. &ldquo;I remember where they all sat.&rdquo; In that year alone, he taught CNN commentator David Gergen, politician William Bennett, and American diplomat Stuart Eizenstat. He explains that a third of his students were older than he was. &ldquo;I was scared out of my wits,&rdquo; he claims, though it&rsquo;s difficult to believe that this man, who practically beams  confidence, has ever felt nervous.</p><p>Regardless, Dershowitz managed to succeed. &ldquo;At the end of the first year, I got the highest ranking of any teacher in terms of teaching,&rdquo; he tells me, and then reiterates, &ldquo;I was 25, and I got the highest teacher ranking. So I was very pleased.&rdquo; Since that first year, Dershowitz has instructed over 10,000 students, including those in the freshman seminar he&rsquo;s taught for about a decade. Dershowitz says he is considering returning to Harvard in future years to teach the seminar, entitled &ldquo;Where Does Your Morality Come From?&rdquo; once again.</p><p>As a professor with extensive time in the courtroom, Dershowitz says he has been able to &ldquo;bring a lot of practical experience into the classroom.&rdquo; He explains that this balance between the theoretical and the practical has been one of his biggest contributions to Harvard. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve made the classroom more interesting by bringing in my practical experience,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve made myself a better lawyer by bringing my academic experience into the courtroom.&rdquo;</p><p>Dershowitz also counts his contributions towards making it &ldquo;easier for Jewish students to express their Jewish values and their support for Israel,&rdquo; as one of his biggest accomplishments at the University. When he first came, he says, people called him the &ldquo;first Jewish Jew at Harvard.&rdquo; He would often quote Jewish sources in his class, was active in Jewish events on campus, and did not hold class on Jewish holidays. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try to hide my identity,&rdquo; Dershowitz said. When he was up for tenure, a colleague warned him that &ldquo;I was wearing my Jewishness on my sleeve,&rdquo; which would hurt his chances. Today, being Jewish at Harvard...is very different from what it was five decades ago, he says, as Harvard is &ldquo;a much more accepting, tolerant place.&rdquo;</p><p>Though times have changed, Dershowitz is still known at Harvard and beyond for stirring up controversy&mdash;he is a man completely unphased when others disagree with him. I ask himwhich of his views have been most criticized at Harvard, to which he responds that his most controversial beliefs are his  support for Israel and his claim that the Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions, BDS, movement against Israel, is &ldquo;both immoral and also hurts the peace process.&rdquo; He adds that students have often objected to views he has expressed, and he defends their right to do so.</p><p>&ldquo;But look,&rdquo; he states proudly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m controversial all over the world.&rdquo; He recently wrote a piece for The Australian opposing the Australian government&rsquo;s ban on Holocaust denial. &ldquo;I believe strongly in free speech,&rdquo; he explains to me. &ldquo;I believe that Nazis have a right to speak freely, anti-Israel people have the right to speak freely, the BDS people have the right to speak freely, and Holocaust deniers&hellip; When they express their views, I want to be there to express my views.&rdquo; As a result of his article, he says, the Jewish community in Australia has claimed that he is supporting Holocaust denial. Dershowitz does not seem to be too bothered by this. The approval of others does not sit high on his priority list.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stuck to my principles over my years,&rdquo; Dershowitz says. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to understand my principles. Sometimes even my mother doesn&rsquo;t understand my principles. But I&rsquo;m too old to change.&rdquo;</p><p>Dershowitz says that his position on the political spectrum has not altered at all. He has always identified as strongly liberal, but he believes that the views of people around him have changed, specifically with regard to Israel, which he says used to be very much a liberal cause. Without any prompting on my end, he delves into his opinions on the matter, explaining that to him, this diminishing support from the left is &ldquo;appalling.&rdquo; He continues, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a liberal and a progressive, you should support the country in the world that has the best record on women&rsquo;s rights, on environmental rights, on gay rights, and that&rsquo;s Israel.&rdquo;</p><p>Dershowitz himself is considering becoming an Israeli citizen in response to the BDS campaign. He wants to be able to say, &ldquo;if you boycott an Israeli, you have to boycott me.&rdquo; Just today, he tells me, he was invited to contribute an article to a British magazine, and he responded by saying &ldquo;if you would not have invited an Israeli, then you can&rsquo;t invite me.&rdquo; He believes this is &ldquo;an appropriate way of fighting back against the immorality of singling out Israel for a BDS campaign.&rdquo;</p><p>I ask if there has ever been an instance where the free speech of Harvard students was restricted by the administration, and if he got involved. &ldquo;I can tell you they tried, but I think I&rsquo;ve made it impossible for them to do it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I have been on the forefront of maintaining free speech and free academic speech at Harvard.&rdquo;</p><p>When Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died, a group of Palestinian students at Harvard asked Dershowitz if he would help them gain the right to raise the Palestinian flag in Harvard Yard. He agreed to represent the Palestinian students on grounds of his support for free speech, and they were able to raise the flag. However, Dershowitz simultaneously issued statements saying that &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t support what they stood for in raising the flag, and that I thought [Arafat] was a horrible, horrible murderer,&rdquo; he says. In this case, free speech allowed for both the Palestinian students&rsquo; tribute to Arafat, and for his response.</p><p>Dershowitz has also taken a stand against what he calls the discriminatory nature of final clubs at Harvard. &ldquo;I myself have never belonged to and would never belong to a club that picks and chooses based on how cool you are,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;so I myself don&rsquo;t approve of final clubs.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, after his &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; from Harvard, Dershowitz says, &ldquo;I want to remain active as long as I can.&rdquo; He boasts that he currently receives calls from political and business leaders all over the world, seeking his advice and consultation. He just finished representing the former president of Ukraine, and is now consulting on a case involving the former prime minister of Pakistan. He&rsquo;s finishing up his next book, entitled &ldquo;Abraham: The World&rsquo;s First (But Certainly not Last) Jewish Lawyer.&rdquo; It is a history of lawyers with a focus on Jewish lawyers. He is also working on an opera.</p><p>Dershowitz is about to board his plane, so we have to wrap up our conversation. I ask what he would tell his students if he could just give one piece of advice. &ldquo;Truth is not an end result, it&rsquo;s a process,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect simple answers&mdash;we live in an extraordinarily complex world.&rdquo;</p>'),

Elliott</a>', '<p>Last month, as many of my friends were off doing their best to recreate the debauchery of “Spring Breakers” (or at least get a tan), I paid $50 to spend the better part of a Thursday with a Staten Island-accented retired postal worker. The man—let’s call him Mr. Kagan—wore his white hair in a comb-over and paraded on exceptionally spindly legs.</p><p>Seven or eight other disgruntled individuals shared in this less-than-glamorous encounter, which took place in a cramped, windowless room of a New York City walkup. There, Kagan paced as he rambled through his life history, delighting in his opportunity to impart curious bits of wisdom to us. Only occasionally did he throw in a remark about road signs, or run toy cars across a white board. The radiator hissed.</p><p>To be clear, this ordeal was only semi-voluntary. Had state law not mandated it, Kagan’s path and my own would likely have never crossed. The problem, you see, is that I am about to graduate college with photo identification that reads “Learner Permit.” And in order to rectify the situation, I needed to enroll in a five-hour pre-licensing course, for which Kagan was the instructor.</p><p>Being license-less at this age was never in the plans, of course. Sure, cars were a novelty, not a necessity for those of us raised in Manhattan. But I, like most American teenagers, pictured myself leaving the nest being able to wield a vehicle. It seemed like just another part of growing up, of becoming an adult.</p>                                                                                                                    <p>Yet here I am: a 22-year-old who cannot live anywhere without excellent public transportation, much less rent a Zipcar.</p><p>I have been perusing Craigslist recently, looking for places to live after graduation. I pause, almost daily, over photographs of a seemingly perfect apartment, only to confront a description such as “ten minute drive to downtown.” Earlier in the year, during my job search, I realized that I am ineligible for all employment requiring a valid driver’s license.</p><p>Perhaps the most upsetting realization took place last March, when my younger brother of three years fulfilled his promise of acquiring his license before me. He texted me photo evidence of his victory, minutes after the DMV printed off his temporary license. Yes, Owen, you won.</p><p>Often, though, I consider my automotive incompetence with a distinct sense of pride. It’s like a stamp of authenticity, proving that I am, indeed, a New Yorker. No car needed.</p><p>I can trace my misgivings about cars to their various points of origin. When I was younger, the only way I could make it through the two hour ride to my grandmother’s house without vomiting was by holding a pillow over my face for the duration of the trip, so as not to inhale the “new car smell.” I outgrew that reflex, thankfully. But in the years since, other, less visceral objections have taken its place.</p><p>I have a habit, when sitting on planes, of selecting the window seat so as to be able to examine the landscapes of takeoff and landing. I like watching the ground tilt and fade as the plane turns, enjoy taking in the topography of the city illuminated by lights, at night. The daytime is never as romantic, though, revealing only rooftops and the cars weaving between them on paved pathways. A world of boxes and enclosures of various sizes and colors, with no humans visible. A space of neither disorder nor contact.</p><p>From these moments of aerial observation, I developed a sense of unease about the isolation cars require—the human interaction they preclude. When my friends—the drivers, I like to call them—discuss being on the road, they do so with a vocabulary of freedom, of exhilaration and release. But I’ve always found wandering by foot to be so much more liberating. My path is less constrained, my encounters with strangers more frequent and less predictable. Walking is messier, and I like that.</p><p>I suppose, though, that it is better to be able to drive but choose not to, than to not have the option at all. And so, in a concession to practicality, I have scheduled what will be my very first (and hopefully last) road test: Tuesday, June 3 at 9 a.m. Not before graduation, as always seemed appropriate, but close enough. Wish me luck.</p><p><span><i>—Rebecca F. Elliott &rsquo;14, a former Fifteen Minutes chair, is a literature concentrator in Winthrop House.

    ('The End of Endpapers', 'end-of-endpapers', 'Leslie B. Arffa&rsquo;s rant.', '<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1206691/Leslie_B._Arffa/">Leslie B. Arffa</a>', '<p>I have always hated endpapers. It is a longstanding FM tradition to give the last page of each issue over to the musings of staff writers who can write about anything they wish. Surely, my FM ancestors must have reasoned, Harvard students have much to reflect on, would be overflowing with anecdotes to fill that 1,000 word page limit. Surely not, in fact.</p><p>Every week as I proofed the pages of FM, I shuddered as I reached the endpaper. It was never the fault of any individual writer. As it turned out, nothing could live up to the promise of blank space. Given the lack of restrictions, endpapers can potentially be profound, funny, insightful, thought-provoking. Instead they’re generally mundane, tiresome, substanceless, pretentious.</p><p>Writers would either overshoot and try to use a story about their summer internship to shed light on the human condition. Or, even worse, they wouldn’t really say anything at all. Hoping, I suppose, that I would find hidden relevance in their “funny” anecdotes about Lowell brain break.</p><p>My hatred of endpapers became a running joke. It mapped on well to my cynicism about oversharing in public spaces. “Here comes another groundbreaking story about how a grandparent’s illness caused him to reevaluate his life choices,” I would announce with my typical combination of sarcasm and eye rolling. “Does anyone actually care about this girl’s dog dying?” I might ask to the horror of my more sympathetic editing staff.</p>                                                                                                                    <p>I called for more editing oversight, I tried to be more selective in who could write them, I petitioned to end the practice altogether. But, buoyed by the support of others, whom I accused of being ridiculously tolerant of stories I labeled “glorified journal entries,” the endpapers endured.</p><p>It’s not that I’m entirely lacking in empathy with the writers. It is hard, of course, to stare at the limitless potential of a blank page. As students we always ask for assignments, prompts, at the very least a few guidelines. The writers, at least, went down fighting. I reached a begrudging stalemate with the endpapers, accepting their existence even as I continued to mock them mercilessly.</p><p>One day in the fall, however, I found myself not just mildly enjoying or tolerating an endpaper, but actually loving an endpaper. So moved was I by this endpaper that I started crying during production, and trust me, I am not one to cry (unless it’s during a particularly moving episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” in which case all bets are off). I wasn’t feeling tired or overly emotional: the endpaper was just that good.</p><p>I’d like to say that the moment changed my opinion forever on endpapers, but it didn’t. I didn’t like them before, and I haven’t liked them since. I certainly don’t like this one. I’ll continue to avoid emotional oversharing. I’ll keep my cynicism and eye rolling. I’ll question whether anything I do can compare to how that one great endpaper found a way to fill a blank space.</p>'),

The most frequently awarded grade at Harvard College is an A.

We’re wondering what he did for the people he really wanted to show up at the ballot box. Maybe referring to homeless people as “an embarrassment” was some sort of weird reverse psychology.

Read on for the ultimate picks.</p><p><b>THE SMITH CAMPUS CENTER</b></p><p><div class="shortcodes-wrapper shortcodes-wrapper-right shortcodes-wrapper-large ">    <div class="shortcodes-object">        <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/image/2013/11/14/campus-center-holyoke-renaming/">    <img src="http://thumbnails.thecrimson.com.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/2013/11/14/155836_1291819.jpg.800x533_q95_crop-smart_upscale.jpg" title="Renaming the Holyoke Center" alt="Renaming the Holyoke Center" /></a>    <div class="shortcodes-byline">        <a href=\'http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1209085/Zorigoo__Tugsbayar/\'>Zorigoo Tugsbayar</a>    </div>    </div></div></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>Claiming to exist. The only renovation to this building is the sign in front. Harvard, you have to remodel the building before you slap a plaque on it. We can only hope that, for the sake of confused tourists seeking Harvard Square landmarks such as Al’s and Oggi’s, they’ve updated the name in guidebooks, too.</p>                                                                                                                    <p><b>At Least They Didn&rsquo;t:</b></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><b> </b></p><p>Take away the giant foosball table.

The most frequently awarded grade at Harvard College is an A. You used to think you were smart, but now you have to deal with all your friends from home telling you that Princeton “actually challenges” its undergraduates. Even worse, you live in fear that the lax bro down the hall also aced his art history final. Wait, he’s Junior 24?</p><p><b>At Least They Didn&rsquo;t:</b></p><p>Ask you what you got.</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>Harvey C. “C-minus” Mansfield ’53 for bitching about grade inflation and nothing happening, ever.</p><p><b>LOGAN LESLIE</b></p><p><div class="shortcodes-wrapper shortcodes-wrapper-right shortcodes-wrapper-large ">    <div class="shortcodes-object">        <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/image/2013/3/12/leslie-city-council/">    <img src="http://thumbnails.thecrimson.com.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/2013/03/12/041004_1285315.jpg.800x533_q95_crop-smart_upscale.jpg" title="" alt="" /></a>    <div class="shortcodes-byline">        <a href=\'http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1210307/Courtesy%20of%20Logan%20E.%20Leslie__%20/\'>Courtesy of Logan E.

Leslie ’16 told The Crimson he wasn’t depending on the student vote to win him a seat on the Cambridge City Council this fall. Keep in mind that this is the guy who handed out bottle openers to students and sent them personal texts on Election Day (“Could you head to Friends Center before 8 PM?” he asked/pleaded. “Ill [sic] owe you one.”). We’re wondering what he did for the people he really wanted to show up at the ballot box. Maybe referring to homeless people as “an embarrassment” was some sort of weird reverse psychology. That’s not why Leslie is on this list of losers, though. He’s here because he is, quite literally, a loser: he finished fourteenth in the election, garnering only 482 first-place votes.</p><p><b>At Least:</b></p><p>The reason he’s a 26-year-old sophomore isn’t the Gov 1310 scandal.</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>Everyone who voted for him.</p><p><b>THE GOV. DEPARTMENT</b></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>You would think that this would be their comeback year. But in December, we learned that the Government Department should really never offer any 1300-level courses. Quincy House sophomore Eldo Kim allegedly issued a bomb threat on the morning of his Gov. 1368 exam, apparently in an effort to avoid taking it. Makes the Gov 1310 cheating scandal look like the good old days. Also, Gov concentrators, sorry for always having to explain why you’re not Social Studies.</p><p><b>At Least They Didn’t:</b></p><p>Have another cheating scandal&hellip;that we know of. Anyone want to share notes for Gov 1315?</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>Every professor who tried to give an exam on December 16.</p><p><b>"IVY"</b></p><p><div class="shortcodes-wrapper shortcodes-wrapper-right shortcodes-wrapper-large ">    <div class="shortcodes-object">        <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/image/2014/3/3/ivy-screenshot/">    <img src="http://media.thecrimson.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/photos/2014/03/03/235631_1294407.png" title="Ivy screenshot" alt="Ivy screenshot" /></a>    <div class="shortcodes-byline">        <a href=\'http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1207853/Courtesy%20of__YouTube/\'>Courtesy of YouTube</a>    </div>    </div></div></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>We don’t want to admit it, but we actually really enjoyed the first episode and may have watched it twice. That being said, a disproportionate number of internationals to domestic Harvard students in the cast, as well as a disproportionate ratio of publicity to number of episodes, puts “IVY” on this list. This “Girls” knock-off is a classic case of trying too hard. If this is anyone’s Harvard experience we’re worried. We like to think everyone at Harvard is just as lame as us. “I just don’t know what I’m doing,” one of the characters says on “IVY.” Maybe the actor’s referring to his extracurricular choices.</p><p><b>At Least They Didn&rsquo;t:</b></p><p>Call it “The Social Network.”</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>“Ivory Tower.” Do they still exist? Too lazy to check.</p><p><b>THE HUMANITIES</b></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>Op-Ed writers across the nation have spoken, and the verdict is out: the humanities are dead.

Okay, I’m full now.</p><p><b>At Least They Didn&rsquo;t:</b></p><p>Change their concentration name, unlike a certain biology major, from something vague but with the possibility of euphemistic word play, to something just plain vague.</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>Latin, for being a dead language this whole time.</p><p><b>KIRKLAND HOUSE</b></p><p><div class="shortcodes-wrapper shortcodes-wrapper-right shortcodes-wrapper-large ">    <div class="shortcodes-object">        <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/image/2014/3/11/Kirkland_Discussion/">    <img src="http://thumbnails.thecrimson.com.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/2014/03/10/212346_1294734.jpg.800x531_q95_crop-smart_upscale.jpg" title="Kirkland Up In Arms" alt="Kirkland Up In Arms" /></a>    <div class="shortcodes-byline">        <a href=\'http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1209115/Tiana_A_Abdulmassih/\'>Tiana A Abdulmassih</a>    </div>    </div></div></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>Beyoncing backfired when a whole visual album dropped by Kirkland residents for Housing Day went wrong. After  complaints of disrespecting women rolled around house-lists, the videos were taken down from Youtube. But not before screenshots were taken of Kirkland women in their underwear (bathing suits?) lying down on the couches that you won’t go near ever again. Nothing screams “welcome freshmen” like a half-naked woman with a paper Kirkland symbol on her face. You just won the lottery?</p><p><b>At least they Didn’t:</b></p><p>Film their “Holiday Dinner and Dance” a.k.a., incest fest, aka, pre-game for awkward Sunday Brunch.</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>Pfoho and Quincy for both having a “Frozen” parody.</p><p><b>THE HARVARD ICHTHUS</b></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>Printing a blog post that argued that the Jewish people deserve the past 2,000 years of persecution because they killed Jesus. The post, written by an anonymous convert to Christianity read, “We, the Jews, collectively rejected God and hung Him up on a cross to die, and thus we deserved the punishments that were heaped on our heads over the last 2000 years.” We, the editors of FM, want to make a joke about this, but Jesus, it’s so hard.</p><p><b>At Least They Didn&rsquo;t:</b></p><p>Distribute to Hillel.</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>The Harvard Crimson’s Editorial Board—if people are reading your articles mainly to laugh at the youthful brazenness of your ideas, it’s probably time to reevaluate your approach.</p><p><b>SHAKE SHACK</b></p><p></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>The new Harvard Square incarnation of Danny Meyer’s much-hyped chain is exactly what we didn’t need: another damn burger joint. This slick eatery is a far cry from the original, beloved outpost in New York’s Madison Square Park, which routinely draws hour-long lines. And they don’t even serve the Shack’s signature crinkle-cut fries, to the horror of many a Yelp reviewer. The Shack’s real blunder, though, is sticking to a puritanical closing time of 11 p.m. (midnight on Fridays and Saturdays), making it an even less appealing late night dining option than Eliot Grille.</p><p><b>At Least They Didn’t:</b></p><p>Stoop to the level of b.good and send us emails about being our “family.”</p><p><b>Honorable Mention:</b></p><p>Tasty Burger, for remaining Shake Shack’s sleazier alternative.</p><p><b>SUSAN PATTON: PRINCETON MOM</b></p><p><b>The Mistakes:</b></p><p>Marrying a man who didn’t go to Princeton and then telling every young woman of the Ivy League not to repeat her mistake. In March, she published a book as a friendly reminder to all the co-eds out there that we should really be spending about 75 percent of our waking hours looking for husbands. We haven’t read it, but we’d guess she spent more than 75 percent of her 250 pages urging us to go snag husbands before we graduate and they disappear forever. We’d rather spend 75 percent of our waking hours watching “Girls.”</p><p><b>At Least She Didn&rsquo;t:</b></p><p>Stay married to the plebian (read: non-Princetonian) she callled her “husband” for 27 years: “He went to a school of almost no name recognition.”</p><p><b>Honorable Mention: </b></p><p>Said ex-husband, for marrying Susan Patton.</p><p><b>AND THE FIVE BIGGEST WINNERS ARE:</b></p><p>1) Evelynn Hammonds</p><p>After Richard Nixon resigned as president, he contracted phlebitis and faced financial ruin. After Evelynn Hammonds resigned as Dean of the College, she was chosen to lead a major research initiative at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. Onward and upward, bitches.</p><p>2) Sam Clark</p><p>Won the UC presidency, (maybe) got us tomato basil ravioli soup, gave a more accurate Yale tour than an actual Yale student could—has zero responsibility.</p><p>3) The Men&rsquo;s Basketball Team</p><p>Busted everyone’s brackets for the second year in a row, made Harvard students turn on ESPN, and proved to the world that they deserve to play with the big dogs. They may not have made it to the “Sweet Sixteen,” but despite this shortcoming, they’re all real tall.</p><p>4) The College Events Board</p><p>Transformed Yardfest from a patriarchal shitshow into a religious experience, even if we dropped our crowdsurfing musical messiah. (Sorry, Janelle!) For once, we didn’t have to flee to Brown or UPenn for an adequate spring concert.</p><p>5) Donald Pfister</p><p>Proved that all it takes to win the universal adoration of the College student body is a quirky, well-written email. You’ll always be dean of our heart.</p>'),
